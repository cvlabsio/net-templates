# Layer-2 Switchport Templates
This directory contains templates for common switchport configurations. This includes a mix of access and trunk ports, data and data+voice ports, and port security versus 802.1X configuration. The ports also include the recommended Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) guard configurations. Assuming DHCP Snooping is operational on the access VLANs, the templates include Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) and IP Source Guard (IPSG) for additional security. You can remove any of these security features if they do not apply to your design.
