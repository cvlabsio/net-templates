# Network Time Protocol (NTP)
This directory has templates for IOS-based NTP masters and clients. Note that the "peer" ACL controls which time sources can update a router's clock, while the "serve" ACL controls which clients the router may serve. Therefore, the NTP master only allows its clock to be updated by other masters ("peer") or itself. The clients typically allow their clocks to be updated by a fixed set of masters or upstream servers. In a hierarchical design, note that you can change the client's "serve" ACL to include downstream clients. This transforms the client into an intermediate server, but the bottom most clients should use deny-any logic.
